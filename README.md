> ðŸ“£ All of our scanning-related efforts have moved to one place, and that is Trivy. Please look at the [migration guide](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/tutorials/tfsec/migration/) and the Trivy [docs](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/) for further information.
## ðŸ“£ tfsec to Trivy Migration

As part of our goal to provide a comprehensive open source security solution for all, we have been consolidating all of our scanning-related efforts in one place, and that is [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy). 

Over the past year, tfsec has laid the foundations to Trivy's IaC & misconfigurations scanning capabilities, including Terraform scanning, which has been natively supported in Trivy for a long time now.

Going forward we want to encourage the tfsec community to transition over to Trivy. Moving to Trivy gives you the same excellent Terraform scanning engine, with some extra benefits:
1. Access to more languages and features in the same tool.
2. Access to more integrations with tools and services through the rich ecosystem around Trivy.
3. Commercially supported by Aqua as well as by a the passionate Trivy community.
tfsec will continue to remain available for the time being, although our engineering attention will be directed at Trivy going forward.

# tfsec-pr-commenter-action
Add comments to pull requests where tfsec checks have failed

To add the action, add `tfsec_pr_commenter.yml` into the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your Github project.

The contents of `tfsec_pr_commenter.yml` should be;

> **Note**: The GITHUB_TOKEN injected to the workflow will need permissions to write on pull requests.
>
> This can be achieved by adding a permissions block in your workflow definition.
>
> See: [docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs)
> for more details.

```yaml
name: tfsec-pr-commenter
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  tfsec:
    name: tfsec PR commenter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - name: Clone repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: tfsec
        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-pr-commenter-action@v1.2.0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

On each pull request and subsequent commit, tfsec will run and add comments to the PR where tfsec has failed.

The comment will only be added once per transgression.

## Optional inputs

There are a number of optional inputs that can be used in the `with:` block.

**working_directory** - the directory to scan in, defaults to `.`, ie current working directory

**tfsec_version** - the version of tfsec to use, defaults to `latest`

**tfsec_args** - the args for tfsec to use (space-separated)

**tfsec_formats** - the formats for tfsec to output (comma-separated)

**commenter_version** - the version of the commenter to use, defaults to `latest`

**soft_fail_commenter** - set to `true` to comment silently without breaking the build

### tfsec_args

`tfsec` provides an [extensive number of arguments](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/latest/guides/usage/), which can be passed through as in the example below:

```yaml
name: tfsec-pr-commenter
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  tfsec:
    name: tfsec PR commenter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Clone repo
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: tfsec
        uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-pr-commenter-action@v1.2.0
        with:
          tfsec_args: --soft-fail
          github_token: ${{ github.token }}
```

### tfsec_formats

`tfsec` provides multiple possible formats for the output:

* default
* json
* csv
* checkstyle
* junit
* sarif
* gif

The `json` format is required and included by default. To add additional formats, set the `tfsec_formats` option to comma-separated values:

```yaml
tfsec_formats: sarif,csv
```
